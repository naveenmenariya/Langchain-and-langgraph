      "The following Python function calculates the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def calculate_factorial(n):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The function `calculate_factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n",
      "*   It first checks if the input is a non-negative integer. If not, it raises a `ValueError` or `TypeError` accordingly.\n",
      "*   For `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function returns `1` since the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.\n",
      "*   For `n > 1`, the function calculates the factorial using a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive) and multiplies the result by each number in the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternative Recursive Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "If you prefer a recursive approach, you can use the following implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def calculate_factorial_recursive(n):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Calculate the factorial of a given integer using recursion.\n",

      "    Args:\n",
      "        n (int): The input number.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "        int: The factorial of the input number.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Raises:\n",
      "        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    if not isinstance(n, int):\n",
      "        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n",
      "    if n < 0:\n",
      "        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n",
      "    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n",
      "        return 1\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return n * calculate_factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
      "    num = 5\n",
      "    try:\n",
      "        factorial = calculate_factorial_recursive(num)\n",

      "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that while the recursive implementation can be more concise, it may cause a stack overflow for large input values due to the recursive function calls. The iterative approach is generally more efficient and safer for large inputs.\n"
